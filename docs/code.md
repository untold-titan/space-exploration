# Class Documentation

## Main
This class functions as the entry point for the game. It isn't used at all other than that.

## Server
This class functions as the main starting point for the server side of things. It is started by the Main, hosts a websocket server, and reacts to messages sent by the client. 

## Room
Contains up to X amount of players, and simplifies communicating with them all. Only used server side.

## Player
It's a class representation of a player! Contains their websocket connection, username, score etc.. Used on both Client and Server sides.

## Client
Connects to the server, and kicks off the UI, Communication, and everything else useful about the game.

## Galaxy, SolarSystem and Planet
These three classes all work together to create the map that players can explore. Used on both client and server. 
Interesting fact, the map is generated by the server, converted to one big string, and then sent to each client.

## Game
The heart and soul of the actual gameplay. Used by both client and server, and hosts the actual gameplay logic.

## WindowManager
The starting point for the actual UI. This class handles all input from the user, and talks to both the Game and Client. Used by client side only.

## RoomLobby, SystemMap, GalacticMap, SpaceStation, CoordinateWindow
These are all UI handler classes, mostly do the same things. React to a UI input, tell the `WindowManager` about it, and carry on.
