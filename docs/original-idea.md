# Space Exploration
This game is a No Man's Sky-esque multiplayer board game, written in Java. 

# Gameplay
The game plays in realtime, with players navigating the galaxy, finding artifacts, and trying to complete one of the victory objectives. The game ends right as soon as someone has achieved one of the victory objectives. 

Each player starts in a system, randomly picked, starting at their home system.

## Objectives
1. The Capitalist
Have $5m units in your wallet.
2. The Conquerer
Eliminate all of the other players, and their home base.
3. The Pioneer
Travel through the center of the Galaxy, to the next galaxy. (Costs a LOT of hyperdrive fuel.)

These 3 objectives are guaranteed to be in the actual game, the next few are just some ideas I had.

4. The Envoy
Meet, and get a good relationship with all the alien races.
5. The Scientist
Discover 60% of all the animal species in the system.

## The Galaxy
The galaxy is randomly generated, (in true No Man's Sky fashion.

### Planets
Sprites are probably going to be AI generated, to prevent me from spending 4 hours drawing things.
