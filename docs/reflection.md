# Reflection
## In General
This was a big project, and a huge undertaking. I think I got a very respectable amount of work done, especially since I technically had to make two seperate applications,
bundled as one, and make sure that they properly interact with each other. I certainly would have liked to do more, and I still have some other features I would have loved 
to add, but there simply wasn't the time allowance for it. As much as I bugged my classmates and had fun in the classroom, I think this is the most work I've ever done on a 
computer science project, and I hope it shows. 

## QA Testing.
This is a big topic to touch on. I got so distracted with trying to actually get as much of the game I forsaw in my mind, that I actually completely forgot bugs were a thing. 
Needless to say, I really didn't do much bug testing, and on the two days I did set aside, I found a few, but I do still know of some bigger ones that I think are still unresolved.
Most of them shouldn't really reveal themselves during typical gameplay, as I took a lot of care to make sure that the gameplay experience was smooth.

## For Future Projects
I think that It would be good to scale back a bit on the ideas. I was able to ship a finished, working project by the end, but like I mentioned, its not what I orginally imagined. 
Most of the extra features I had thought of were all related to gameplay, and as a result of not being able to implement them, the actual gameplay is rather dry, and VERY repeatitive, 
while also being boring. Funnily enough I feel proud of what I made, regardless, as this project is something I have never done before, and it all became a reality thanks to my curiosity.

## In Conclusion
`space-exploration` is a game, that I wouldn't actually praise for being a game, I'd praise it for being an advanced project that is the first of its kind from this computer science class.
It certainly won't be the last though. I expect there will be even crazier things as the class grows, the content changes, and who knows, maybe websockets in java just becomes part of the 
main course content at some point. What I'm saying is, I'm quite proud of this project, and it has been a pleasure being in Mr. Richardson's computer sci class.
